# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
  - function_body_length
  - shorthand_operator
  - opening_brace
  - line_length
  - statement_position
  - todo
  - for_where
  - non_optional_string_data_conversion
  - inclusive_language
  - orphaned_doc_comment
  - redundant_optional_initialization
  - nesting
  - trailing_whitespace
  - cyclomatic_complexity # remove this later
opt_in_rules: # some rules are turned off by default, so you need to opt-in
  - empty_count # find all the available rules by running: `swiftlint rules`
  - explicit_init
#  - contrasted_opening_brace
  - explicit_type_interface # Force the specification of types

# Alternatively, specify all rules explicitly by uncommenting this option:
# only_rules: # delete `disabled_rules` & `opt_in_rules` if using this
#   - empty_parameters
#   - vertical_whitespace

analyzer_rules: # rules run by `swiftlint analyze`
  - explicit_self

excluded: # case-sensitive paths to ignore during linting. Takes precedence over `included`
